# Contributing to the Project

The `ScientificTypesAliases.jl` project is open sourced and open to contribution!
If you would like to contribute to the project, you should know:

1. The [README](README.md) contains a quick summary of the contributing guidelines.
2. The [contributing guide](https://ap6yc.github.io/ScientificTypesAliases.jl/stable/man/contributing.html) in the official documentation provides an in-depth guide to contributing, such as how to do GitFlow, how to develop in Julia, and how the internals of the package work.

In summary, the main point of contact is the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/AP6YC/ScientificTypesAliases.jl/issues), and code development follows the GitFlow paradigm (i.e., create a `feature/...` branch off of the latest `develop` and submit a pull request).
