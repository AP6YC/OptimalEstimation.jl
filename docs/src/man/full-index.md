# [Index](@id main-index)

This page lists the core methods and types of the `AdaptiveResonance.jl` package.
The [Methods](@ref index-methods) section lists the public methods for the package that use the modules in [Types](@ref index-types).
Each of these entries link to the docstrings in the [Docs](@ref index-docs) section.

ART modules document their internal working parameters and references, while their hyperparameters/options are documented under their corresponding option structs `opts_...`.
